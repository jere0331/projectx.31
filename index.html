                <p>Here are some of the things that have shattered the skylight 
                of the NoHo apartment owned by Jeffrey and Suzanne Stewart: a hammer, 
                concrete and a 50-pound slab of wood.</p>
                
                <p>In a saga that has lasted nearly a decade, these objects have fallen
                from a construction site next door, damaging the couple’s 20-pane skylight on three separate 
                occasions. The Stewarts, who live on Great Jones Street with their two children, have found 
                themselves living a New Yorker’s nightmare: Seemingly endless construction has turned their home 
                into a miserable place to live</p>

                        <p>Their apartment, a duplex penthouse with a floating staircase, private roof and
                            three terraces, is shrouded in scaffolding, damaged by water leaks and has been pelted
                            with debris. Second Development Services’s project next door began around 2008 as a hotel, 
                            but languished unfinished for years. It will eventually emerge as an 11-story condo 
                            called 22 Bond, which has since 2013 been under development by Second Development Services 
                            and Richport Group.</p>

                        <p>In a city that never stops building, New Yorkers have become hardened to some of the
                        inconveniences. We expect the jackhammers, the sidewalk bridges and the cranes. But we also 
                        expect that an eyesore will eventually go away and reveal some shiny new thing. The idea that
                        a project would drag on for nine years in a booming real estate market “was never in the realm
                        of possibilities,” said Ms. Stewart, a founder of a software company. While other projects 
                        have opened around the neighborhood, “we are still stuck with this thing next door.”</p>

                                 <p>A developer often needs access to nearby properties to get the work done — 
                                    this is New York after all, where buildings share walls and construction happens 
                                    in tight spaces. But the neighbors need to know that the arrival of telltale plywood
                                    fencing and the work that follows will not damage their property</p>
                            
                                <p>Cue the lawyers, engineers and architects. Usually, the two sides hammer out a deal
                                     where the developer pays the affected property what is called a licensing fee, often 
                                     around $2,000 a month, in exchange for access. The fee usually covers costs for 
                                     building experts and it can sometimes appease disgruntled neighbors.</p>
                            
                                <p>In 2014, a few of the condo owners at 255 Hudson Street were fed up with construction 
                                    at a neighboring site. Scaffolding covered some residents’ windows and sparks, presumably 
                                    from welding equipment, had fallen onto a townhouse owner’s terrace. “I remember going up into 
                                    one guy’s apartment and you couldn’t see out his window,” said Robert J. Braverman, a Manhattan
                                     real estate lawyer who represents 255 Hudson Street, about a different resident.</p>

                                        a boutique hotel, done. The developer worked out a deal with the building in early 2015. 
                                        “We met with them, had coffee with them, broke bread,” said David Adler, the president of the 2
                                        55 Hudson Street condo board.</p>
                                        
                                        
                                        <p>Residents who faced scaffolding would receive vouchers for 10 nights’ free stay at one 
                                        of the developer’s hotels. The townhouse owner was offered 15 free nights. The condo board 
                                        also received $10,000 to wash the building’s windows. The aggrieved residents were largely 
                                        satisfied and Arlo SoHo opened in September 2016. “You can’t be a hotheaded condo association. 
                                        It just doesn’t work,” Mr. Adler said. As for the developers, “the smart guys know that you get
                                        more with honey.”</p>
                                        
                                        <p>If all goes well, a project is built, the scaffolding comes down and life goes on. But construction
                                        does not always go well. Sometimes, it crashes into your apartment.
                                        “When you’re dealing with a gang who can’t shoot straight and are using third-rate contractors, there is
                                        a possibility of damage and of things going wrong,” said Phyllis H. Weisberg, the co-chairwoman of the real
                                        estate practice in the New York office of the law firm Montgomery McCracken Walker & Rhoads, speaking generally
                                        about construction.</p>

                                                    to protect apartments from further damage. But the scaffolding subsequently damaged condo terraces and

                                                    It’s dark. The reason you have a penthouse is to have access to light and outdoors and we don’t have that.”Last 
                                                    November, after the licensing agreement expired, the condo association sued the developers for damages, demanding 
                                                    that they remove the scaffolding and pay for repairs. In a separate suit, the Stewarts sued for damages and for 
                                                    about $40,000 in unpaid licensing fees. The condo has denied the developers access to the site until a new agreemen
